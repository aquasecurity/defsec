		ShortCode:  "require-s3-bucket-policy-change-alarm",
		Summary:    "Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes",
		Impact:     "Misconfigured policies on S3 buckets could lead to data leakage, without alerting visibility of this is reduced.",
		Resolution: "Create an alarm to alert on S3 Bucket policy changes",

		Explanation: `You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.   
                                                                              
CIS recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for changes to S3 bucket policies. Monitoring these changes might reduce time to detect and correct permissive policies on sensitive S3 buckets.`,
