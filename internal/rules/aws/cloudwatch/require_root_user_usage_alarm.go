		ShortCode:  "require-root-user-usage-alarm",
		Summary:    "Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of root user",
		Impact:     "The root user has significant permissions and should not be used for day to day tasks.",
		Resolution: "Create an alarm to alert on root user login",

		Explanation: ` You can do real-time monitoring of API calls directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.   
                                                                              
CIS recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for root user login attempts. Monitoring for root user logins provides visibility into the use of a fully privileged account and an opportunity to reduce the use of it.`,
