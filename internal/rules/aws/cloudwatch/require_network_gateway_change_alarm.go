		Summary:    "Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to network gateways",
		Impact:     "Network gateways control the ingress and egress, changes could be made to maliciously allow egress of data or external ingress. Without alerting, this could go unnoticed.",
		Resolution: "Create an alarm to alert on network gateway changes",

		Explanation: `You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.   
Network gateways are required to send and receive traffic to a destination outside a VPC.                                                              
                                                                            
CIS recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for changes to network gateways. Monitoring these changes helps ensure that all ingress and egress traffic traverses the VPC border via a controlled path.`,
