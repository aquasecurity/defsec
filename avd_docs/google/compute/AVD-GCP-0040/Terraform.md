Use managed keys or provide the raw key via a secrets manager 

```hcl
resource "google_compute_disk" "good_example" {
  name  = "test-disk"
  type  = "pd-ssd"
  zone  = "us-central1-a"
  image = "debian-9-stretch-v20200805"
  labels = {
    environment = "dev"
  }
  physical_block_size_bytes = 4096
}
```
