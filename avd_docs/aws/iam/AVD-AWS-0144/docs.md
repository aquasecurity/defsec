CIS recommends that you remove or deactivate all credentials that have been unused in 90 days or more. Disabling or removing unnecessary credentials reduces the window of opportunity for credentials associated with a compromised or abandoned account to be used.
			

### Impact
Leaving unused credentials active widens the scope for compromise.
