To resolve this issue, [create an IAM group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_create.html), and attach the policy to the group. Then, [add the users to the group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_add-remove-users.html). The policy is applied to each user in the group. To remove a policy attached directly to a user, see [Adding and removing IAM identity permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.
