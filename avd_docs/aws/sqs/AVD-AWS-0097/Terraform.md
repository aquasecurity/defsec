Keep policy scope to the minimum that is required to be effective

```hcl
 resource "aws_sqs_queue_policy" "good_example" {
   queue_url = aws_sqs_queue.q.id
 
   policy = <<POLICY
 {
   "Statement": [
     {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": "*",
       "Action": "sqs:SendMessage"
     }
   ]
 }
 POLICY
 }
 
```
