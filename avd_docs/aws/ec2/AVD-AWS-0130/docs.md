IMDS v2 (Instance Metadata Service) introduced session authentication tokens which improve security when talking to IMDS.
By default <code>aws_instance</code> resource sets IMDS session auth tokens to be optional. 
To fully protect IMDS you need to enable session tokens by using <code>metadata_options</code> block and its <code>http_tokens</code> variable set to <code>required</code>.


### Impact
Instance metadata service can be interacted with freely
