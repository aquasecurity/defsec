		Summary:    "Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for disabling or scheduled deletion of customer managed keys",
		Impact:     "CloudTrail tracks all changes through the API, attempts to change the configuration may indicate malicious activity. Without alerting on changes, visibility of this activity is reduced.",
		Resolution: "Create an alarm to alert on CMKs being disabled or scheduled for deletion",
		Frameworks: map[framework.Framework][]string{
			framework.CIS_AWS_1_2: {
				"3.7",
			},
			framework.CIS_AWS_1_4: {
				"4.7",
			},
		},
		Explanation: `You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.   
                                                                              
  CIS recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for customer managed keys that have changed state to disabled or scheduled deletion. Data encrypted with disabled or deleted keys is no longer accessible. `,
