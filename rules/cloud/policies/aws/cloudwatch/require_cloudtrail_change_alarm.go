		Summary:    "Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for CloudTrail configuration changes",
		Impact:     "CloudTrail tracks all changes through the API, attempts to change the configuration may indicate malicious activity. Without alerting on changes, visibility of this activity is reduced.",
		Resolution: "Create an alarm to alert on CloudTrail configuration changes",
		Frameworks: map[framework.Framework][]string{
			framework.CIS_AWS_1_2: {
				"3.5",
			},
			framework.CIS_AWS_1_4: {
				"4.5",
			},
		},
		Explanation: `You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.   
                                                                              
CIS recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for changes to CloudTrail configuration settings. Monitoring these changes helps ensure sustained visibility to activities in the account.`,
