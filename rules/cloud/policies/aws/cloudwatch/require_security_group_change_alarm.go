		Summary:    "Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for security group changes",
		Impact:     "Security groups control the ingress and egress, changes could be made to maliciously allow egress of data or external ingress. Without alerting, this could go unnoticed.",

		Explanation: `You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.   
Security groups are a stateful packet filter that controls ingress and egress traffic in a VPC.                                                    
                                                                              
CIS recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for changes to security groups. Monitoring these changes helps ensure that resources and services aren't unintentionally exposed.`,
