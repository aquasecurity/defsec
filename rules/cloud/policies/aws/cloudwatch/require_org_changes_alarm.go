		Explanation: `
Monitoring AWS Organizations changes can help you prevent any unwanted, accidental or
intentional modifications that may lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches.
This monitoring technique helps you to ensure that any unexpected changes performed
within your AWS Organizations can be investigated and any unwanted changes can be
rolled back.
