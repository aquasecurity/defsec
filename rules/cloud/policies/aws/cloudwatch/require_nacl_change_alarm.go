		Summary:    "Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to Network Access Control Lists (NACL)",
		Impact:     "Network ACLs control the ingress and egress, changes could be made to maliciously allow egress of data or external ingress. Without alerting, this could go unnoticed.",
		Resolution: "Create an alarm to alert on network acl changes",
		Frameworks: map[framework.Framework][]string{

		Explanation: `You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.   
NACLs are used as a stateless packet filter to control ingress and egress traffic for subnets in a VPC.                                               
                                                                              
CIS recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for changes to NACLs. Monitoring these changes helps ensure that AWS resources and services aren't unintentionally exposed.`,
